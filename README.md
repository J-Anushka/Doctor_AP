How to Use:

1. Open auth.html in a browser.

2. Enter your name, email, and password to "sign in".

3. You will be redirected to index.html, which displays your personalized dashboard.

4. Doctor name is stored using localStorage.

5. All appointment data is currently hardcoded in script.js (can be linked to a backend later).
